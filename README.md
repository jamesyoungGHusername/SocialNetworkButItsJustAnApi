    A mongoose back-end for a hypothetical social media platform, made for a course at DU. It saves "users" along with their friends lists, and lists of "thoughts" and "reactions" posted by those users.

  # Installation

  It can be downloaded from GitHub, and run using the terminal. Once the server is started you'll need to use insomnia or some other tool to actually make the calls to the database since there's no associated front end. Refer to the router files for what paths to make calls to.
  

  # Usage 

  This could either be hooked up to a front end or simply used with insomnia or some other similar tool. To get started, clone the project and run npm i. After starting the server one can add users, add thoughts, and reactions to those thoughts. One can also delete those thoughts, reactions and users.

  Currently this lacks a good way of logging in securely, and should be used with bcrypt or some other tool.
